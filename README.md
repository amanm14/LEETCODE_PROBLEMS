# LeetCode & DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** and **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems.  
Iâ€™m solving these to improve my problem-solving skills and for interview preparation.

##  Folder Structure
Leetcode_Problems/
â”‚â”€â”€ Arrays/
â”‚â”€â”€ String
â”‚â”€â”€ Stacks/
â”‚â”€â”€
â”‚â”€â”€ Trees/
â”‚â”€â”€ DP/
â”‚â”€â”€ Graphs/

##  Languages Used
- C++ (all solutions are written in modern C++ with STL)

---

##  Notes
- Each solution contains **only the function** required for submission (no `main()`),  
  since thatâ€™s how platforms like LeetCode expect it.  
- I will keep updating this repo as I solve more problems.

## Goal
Build a clean and structured collection of solutions to revise faster before interviews ðŸš€
